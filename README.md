# Instagram to discord post images

This script executes 2 actions:

1. Monitors for new image posted in a instagram account.
2. If found new image, a bot posts new instagram image in a discord channel.
3. Repeat after set interval.

## Requirements:

- Python v3
- Python module re, json, requests

## Usage:

Change strings in INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNTS to the names of the accounts you want to pull posts from.
I'm running my bot directly from this repository, so my accounts are already specified.
